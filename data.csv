Just finished watching #MyGoldenLife ystrdays ep! My poor JiAn, she only appears at the end of this ep without saying a words! https://t.co/MIotVBbNOR
Ok so the main character was only shown in the last 30 secs and it seems like she has an amnesiaüò©. Why do KDramas and Pinoy dramas LOVE the amnesia plotüôÑ? Poor Ji Soo, everybody, from Hyuk to her real and 2nd family loves Ji An more than her Miss No misses her! #MyGoldenLife https://t.co/MOsGBFIvhT
While Jian actually thinking of her mistakes for going to Haesong because of money. Thats why she felt guilty towards everybody include Jisoo and dont dare to tell. Jian quite a secretive and lonely person. #mygoldenlife.
And thats why she slapped Jian.. Because Jian thinks too narrow. Try to solve problem by herself while she had a twin sister to help her.to her, Jian's attitude shows that Jian doesnt recognize her as her twins anymore. #mygoldenlife

And only she can do that attitude because she is the real daughter. She is in really good time now to show her real attitude : like mother like daughterüòè #MyGoldenLife
So that her parent wont be in trouble of her real parents. #MyGoldenLife
Jisoo always think that blood related does not important before she knnow the truth. She still thinks like that, if she is real selfish, she will still stay comfort at seo's house. She is not selfish. She went to the real parents when mr. Seo told her to. #MyGoldenLife
Its quite sad for jisoo because she thought her dad called her despite of her real dad. #MyGoldenLife
